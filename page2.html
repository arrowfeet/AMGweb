        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; AMG was founded and started by two incredibily
          intellegent former Mercedes-Benz engineer Erhard Melcher and Hans
          Werner Aufrecht at 1967. At first, Aufrecht was a huge Motorsport fan
          who worked at the Mercedes engine department, specialized in making
          the engine perform higher than making and developing the engine of the
          vehicle. However due to the worst result that Mercedes got back from
          the "Le Mans 24" Mercedes did not want to produce or work on
          high-performance vehicles or Motorsport. Aufrecht and Melcher decide
          to leave the company because he knew that he won't be able to do what
          he is specialized at it.

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; They opened a shop at Burgstall, Germany to test, design,
          Produce racing engines. They soon discovered that Mercedes engines had
          a demand for high-performance upgrades and customization. They started
          to produce high-quality performance vehicles which were proved by
          returning with multiple wins from multiple diffrent races. By the end
          of 1999, Mercedes went all-in with AMG, buying a controlling share of
          AMG and making AMG cars part of the official Mercedes-Benz line-up
          after recognizing the passion and effort.

          &nbsp;&nbsp; It has been more than 50years since the start of AMG.
          Numerous AMG engines and final products are considered revolutionary.
          One of the most revolutionary products that Mercedes introduced to the
          world was the AMG Hammer Sedan. It was a modified version of Mercedes
          E-class(W124) which proved AMG's performance modification to a new
          level by squeezing 5.6-liter V8 with quad-valve technology into a
          mid-size sedan. It was the world's fastest passenger Sedan at the
          time.

          Out of multiple incredible achievements that AMG made, the recent
          legendary achievements that AMG made was Mercedes-Benz SL 65 AMG Black
          Series which was launched in the year 2008. It had a 6.0-liter
          turbocharged V12 producing 661hp. SL 65 featured pure-bed motorsport
          technology along with lightweight structure and design introducing
          sports car fans to a whole new world in terms of dynamic performance.
